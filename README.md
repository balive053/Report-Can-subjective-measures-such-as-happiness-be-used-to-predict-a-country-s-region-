# Report: "Can subjective measures such as happiness be used to predict a country's region? A study on indicators from a decade of world data."
This is the full Report and findings based one of my university works. It first explores the dataset looking at possible correlations etc. between features and regions before going more in depth to analyse the factors most associated with regional prediction and uses predictive models such as decision trees, ensembles etc. to determine if a country's region can accurately be predicted based on subjective as well and factual data from the world happiness report.
